# BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The bank management system is a set of essential tools and processes that allow banks and their credit institutions to carry out their functions. The components of the bank management system may differ depending on the bank, but generally, the system includes core banking to manage basic transactions, loans, mortgages, and payments accessible via ATM, mobile banking, and branches. Other components that may be included are CRM systems, Risk Management Systems, Human Resource Management Systems, and Business Intelligence systems.

## System Requirements
The requirements for a bank management system provide a complete description of the system behavior and are based on the business expectations. The functioning of the system must comply with the laws and regulatory acts of the country.
